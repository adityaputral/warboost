            <p class="justify">
                Warung Boosting is a site offering boosting services in numerous games.
                We started boosting in 2019 and were slowly growing.
                We have features that put us miles ahead of our competition including chat with booster,
                fast starting time of your order thanks to our system that notifies all boosters.
                Our support is usually online 24/7. You can browse through profiles of our
                boosters and choose the one you like most. You can always share your feedback and ideas with
                us. We will be happy to overview and implement them if they are good!

                Our boosters are handpicked - we always make sure to choose the best players in each game.
                All of them are verified and tested and under strict rules. We do our best to ensure there will
                always be enough of different boosters in terms of their region, heroes they play, things they
                focus on - so you can be sure there will always be someone to finish your order. You can see the
                number of available boosters below the image of each product - this number is taken from amount
                of boosters assigned to certain game minus those who are working on someone's order - it is
                automatically updated and always accurate - something you can rely on.
